The data was pulled from these sources:

1. PatentsView (patents, inventors, assignees): https://www.patentsview.org
2. FedRePORTER (grants, principal investigators, organizations): https://federalreporter.nih.gov/FileDownload

NOTE for the ML notebook example the sample data is too large to store on github, so we stored it on a Drive folder. You can download it here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GyXYBVQOCqFndH6rM26ajoX3hhiyNg5M
The data for that sample was downloaded from NIH Exporter (patent-grant links, more detailed grant information): https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx?sid=0&index=3
