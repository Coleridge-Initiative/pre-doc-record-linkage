### set-up

Anaconda provides a nice [conda cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) which includes commands for setting up and creating virtual environments.

The below command should

`conda env create -f py3-rl.yml`
